Running Apps List
=================

This is a simple Gnome Extension developed to recreate the Window List Menu applet from Legacy Gnome. It adds a single icon to the panel and opens up a list to show all windows across all workspaces. These windows are grouped by workspace and make it simple to jump to any currently running app across all workspaces. Window names wrapped in [ ] are minimized and will be unminimized when selected.

Version 2 added workspace names if they are defined in the desktop settings.

Version 4 cleaned up the panel layout and added extra feedback like identying the current workspace, scrollbars when the window list gets too long and workspace switcher buttons to all windows listed.

Version 10 added preferences to alter basic style and functionality

Features to be added
====================

* Use the desktop signature color for the workspace section headers (waiting for libadwaita).

* Drag and drop windows to different workspaces. Added workspace switcher arrows instead, but could add drag and drop in the future.
