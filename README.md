Running Apps List
=================

This is a simple Gnome Extension developed to recreate the Window List Menu applet from Legacy Gnome. It adds a single icon to the panel and opens up a list to show all windows across all workspaces. These windows are grouped by workspace and make it simple to jump to any currently running app across all workspaces. Window names wrapped in [ ] are minimized and will be unminimized when selected.

Version 2 added workspace names if they are defined in the desktop settings.

Features to be added
====================

* Use the desktop signature color for the workspace section headers.

* Option to move selected window to the current workspace, instead of switching to the apps workspace.

* A right click menu on an app, with options to goto the app or close the app.

* Drag and drop windows to different workspaces

* Icon on workspace lines to switch to different workspaces
